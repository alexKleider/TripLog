# File: README

A place to store trip logs and develop a utility (reverse.py) that
will take a trip log as input and return a log of the same trip going
in the oposite direction.

Trip logs: each valid line must begin with distance (Km or miles)
followed by text. All other lines must begin with '#' (ignored.)
Out put is a listing of the same waypoints in reverse order.
